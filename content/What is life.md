Keeping an eye on the scoreboard all the time doesn't help even in a basketball game. 

And life is not a basketball game, neither is there a scoreboard.

LIfe is more a like a train track, with endless intersections. You are like a train. And you don't have the speed control, you are moving with a constant speed. 

Life goes on, you move or not. I guess life is just time.

Your mind is like the driver, but again, minus the speed controls. 

At each point of intersections, you might see all the possible tracks ahead, or you might not. You will be able to see those only which you are able to notice. You will notice only those which you have been trained to notice.

Or you can "train" yourself.

See that rabbit hole, bottomless. Feel that new business idea that calls your inner Alice (from wonderland of course) but scares the hell out of you. There is a track underneath. 

See that yellow brick road, not built for train wheels. Feel that --new inspiration-- that calls your Dorothy. Might not seem like it, but there is a track underneath.

There are no wrong paths in life, there are not paths even. There are just intersections. 
Some turns have a better chance of keeping you alive, other might have better chance of keeping you happier.

You might think you are moving in a higher speed sometimes, it is just the environment changing rapidly.
You might think you are moving rapidly towards that end of project because you are working more hours, you are just taking a turn towards difficult terrain (not bad or good necessarily) which might land you on the next intersection sooner.
 
And just like the train and train driver you might be thinking that you are deciding where you are going. And like them, you will be wrong. 

Yes you might have seeming control over your choice of turns, but the turns were always there, even if you think you created them. Wherever you are, wherever you will be, is a not only a product of your turns but also the environment in which your tracks were.

Don't keep a score. Put milestones if you must. Use them to make your own path and decide your own turns. But don't keep looking at them. Coz you might crash.
 
But where will you crash. Everything is a track :D. Surprise, there is no crashing, only death ;D. So, try to enjoy the chug-chug.
